# Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning

A deep learning project for predicting diseases based on medical data and patient history.

## Overview

This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict diseases by analyzing medical data and patient history. The goal is to build a robust model that can assist in early diagnosis and contribute to proactive healthcare.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Gathered and curated medical datasets containing relevant features for disease prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values and normalizing features.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Developed a deep neural network architecture for disease prediction, considering the complexity and diversity of medical data.
- **Model Training:** Trained the deep learning model using labeled datasets, optimizing for high accuracy and sensitivity in disease detection.
- **Interpretability:** Conducted analyses to interpret model predictions and understand the key factors influencing disease predictions.
- **Scalability:** Designed the model to be scalable for integration into healthcare systems for real-time predictions.
